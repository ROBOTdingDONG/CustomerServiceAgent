Use Case Examples
Sales Inquiry Handling
Imagine a customer asks about the pricing of your product. The bot can automatically recognize this as a sales inquiry and provide the relevant pricing information, along with any ongoing discounts or offers.

Product Recommendation
A customer is unsure about which product suits their needs best. The bot can ask a series of qualifying questions and recommend the best product based on the customer's answers.

Troubleshooting Support
A customer is facing issues with their product. The bot can guide the customer through a series of troubleshooting steps to resolve common issues or escalate the problem to a human agent if it can't be resolved.
